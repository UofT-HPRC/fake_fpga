In the modelsim distribution, there is a file called mtipli.lib on 
windows, and one called libmtipli.so. On my windows computer, I 
found it in $MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/win32pe_edu/mtipli.lib, and on
my Linux computer, I found it in 
$MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/modeltech/linux-x86_64/libmtipli.so.

Please copy the mtipli.lib (or libmtipli.so on Linux) file into this 
directory.

(I don't provide it because there is probably some kind of legal issue
with putting this file on github)
