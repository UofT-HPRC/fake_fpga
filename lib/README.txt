In the modelsim distribution, there is a file called mtipli.lib. On my
computer I found it in $MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/win32pe_edu/mtipli.lib.

Please copy your mtipli.lib file into this directory.

(I don't provide it because there is probably some kind of legal issue
with putting this file on github)
