In the modelsim distribution, there is a file called vpi_user.h and one
called vpi_compatibility.h. On my computer I found these in 
$MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/include/.

Please copy your vpi_user.h and vpi_compatibility.h files into this
directory.

(I don't provide them because there is probably some kind of legal issue
with putting these file on github)
